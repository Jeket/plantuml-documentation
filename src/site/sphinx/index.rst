PlantUML Overview
*****************

PlantUML takes text and turns them into UML diagrams.  You can create these UML digrams:

* Sequence
* Usecase diagram
* Class diagram
* Activity diagram
* Component diagram
* State diagram
* Object diagram
* Deployment diagram
* Timing diagram

PlantUML also creates these non-UML diagrams:

* Wireframe graphical interface
* Archimate diagram
* Specification and Description Language (SDL)
* Ditaa diagram
* Gantt diagram
* Mathematic with AsciiMath or JLaTeXMath notation

PlantUMl uses graphViz to generate the diagrams in many different file formats, including

* png
* svg
* dot
* laTeX
