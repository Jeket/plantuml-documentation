Ashley's PlantUML Information
#############################


I wrote this because I find the documentation for PlantUML lacking.  It's hard to figure out exactly what commands
can and cannot be used in what contexts.  It's not obvious how to find all of the options for skinparams (which set the style / look & feel for your diagrams)


PlantUML is really helpful.  If it were easier to use, it would be even more helpful!
Documenting it better helps to make it easier to use and is something I can contribute.

Note that this is a total work in progress.  I'm just getting started with this.
If you have any suggestions, contributions, or questions, let me know:  .

   understand index pairs and triples better.  I think I'm misusing them.
