Adjusting the Style of your Diagrams using //Skin Param//
*********************************************************

You can control how your diagrams look -- the _style_ -- with skin parameters, or "skin_param" settings.

("skin" comes from... and param = parameter)

you can put in individual settings in your diagram:
(example)

or you can create a separate file with all of the skin_param settings that you like
and then tell your diagrams to "include" your skin_param settings file:
(example)

This will apply _all_ of the settings in your skin_param settings file to your diagram.

Common skin_param settings:



TODO: Generate all of the skin param settings and their definitions/descriptions
TODO: Generate all of the skin param settings that apply to each (a) diagram
